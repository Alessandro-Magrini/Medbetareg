Description: Software implementing the methodology proposed by Magrini et al. (2018) <DOI:10.17713/ajs.v47i3.629>. The elicitation of an informative prior distribution on parameters of a univariate conditional model is typically difficult when the response is a medical continuous variable, because some level of statistical training is required to a medical expert for interpreting parameters and for retrieving appropriate quantitative information about them. Magrini et al. (2018) proposed a generalized Beta regression where parameter elicitation is performed by establishing a correspondence among measured values expressed as relative positions within intervals with a clinical interpretation, regardless the original scales of variables.
